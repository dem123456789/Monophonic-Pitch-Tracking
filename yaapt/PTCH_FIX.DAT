PITCH_HALF:	0			// attempt to eliminate pitch halves
					// 0 = no, 1 = zero them, 2 = double them

PITCH_HALF_SENS: 2.8			// Sensitivity - number of std devs away
					// from the mean before being identified

PITCH_DOUBLE:	0			// Attempt to correct pitch doubles
					// 0 = no, 1 = zero them, 2 = halve them

PITCH_DOUBLE_SENS: 3.3			// Sensitivity - number of std devs away 
					// from the mean before being identified

SMOOTH_INTERP:	1			// Smoothly interpolate unvoiced regions
                           		// 0 no, 1 yes
SMOOTH_FACTOR:	5			// Parameter for smoothing median filter
					// Odd numbers are best (default = 5)

SMOOTH:		0			// Smooth the track (after interpolation)
